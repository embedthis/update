**ISSUES will not receive priority that do not complete this template. They will be flagged as "Insufficient Information" and may be closed without any action.**

**Describe the bug**

A clear and complete description of what the bug is. Please explain in detail what the bug is. Most people are too brief in the description and it results in delays addressing issues as we go back and forth with questions. Please spend some time writing a complete description.

Please don't just paste an issue with this template not completed with all required information.

**To Reproduce**

Include a link to a gist or repository containing details that reproduces your issue. Reproductions must be short, correct, self-contained and must not contain code that isn't relevant to the issue. Please do NOT just paste code from your project. Explaining how to reproduce is most often insufficient. It may be clear to you, but typically is less than clear to others. Furthermore, it puts the burden of creating a test case onto the volunteer maintainers and isn't scalable. If such a reproduction is not provided, the issue may be closed without comment.

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Clone this repository
2. Edit your reproducible, MINIMAL, stand-alone test case.

If you don't provide a complete test case that demonstrates your issue, then your issue will not receive priority and may be closed without comment.

Ensure that your test case includes:

1. Actual API code that is failing. Don't use code snippets. Add comments where helpful.
2. Run the updater in verbose mode and capture all relevant logs.
3. The test case is a minimal as possible. Remove all unnecessary code and options.

Check that:

1. You are using a current version of the updater and tools

**Cut/Paste**

Include the code from your test case here and replace the CODE segment. Remember to preserve the three backticks above and below the code block.  See [Formatting Code](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-format-code-in-markdown/) for details.
